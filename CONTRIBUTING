Since this project is open-source, you are welcome to contribute.

This project uses multiple git branches:
* feature branches are used to add enhancements to the project. They must
be named after the issue they're referring (e.g. issue XP-003 is targeted in
feature branch XP-003). They are later merged into develop when the feature
is finished.
* develop branch is the core branch. It is used to group all done features. It
can occasionally contain hotfixes.
* release branches are created each time a new release is started. They are
merged from develop when all planned features are ready. They can also
contain specific release fixes (e.g. change of configuration, version
number)
* master branch is merged from release branches (a tag must be added each
time a release is pulled)
